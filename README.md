## Overview
The primary goal of this project is to provide a main.java.simulation-based approach to complement the analytical model developed within the scope of the Coordination and Management of Uncertainty in Refugee Camp Inventory Operations project. By simulating various scenarios, this study aims to derive valuable managerial insights, demonstrating how proposed policies and strategies could be implemented in real-life situations. The main.java.simulation will offer practical insights across different scenarios, enabling users to draw meaningful conclusions when analytical solutions may be difficult or impractical.

## 📄 Paper Abstract
Natural disasters and conflicts often result in humanitarian crises, necessitating effective inventory management to meet the needs of displaced populations. This paper introduces a sophisticated main.java.simulation model tailored for disaster relief scenarios. By integrating real-world dynamics and constraints, such as perishability of goods, budget constraints, and uncertain demand, the model offers a robust framework for decision-makers in humanitarian organizations addressing post-disaster inventory management challenges. The main.java.simulation tool is open source, promoting widespread adoption and adaptation, thereby enriching the humanitarian logistics toolbox. Computational experiments are conducted to validate the main.java.simulation engine and provide valuable insights.
